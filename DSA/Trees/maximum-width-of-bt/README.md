## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the **maximum width** of the given tree.

The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among **all levels** . The width of a level is determined by measuring the distance between its end nodes, which are the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes. The length calculation additionally takes into account the null nodes that would be present between the end nodes if a complete binary tree were to stretch down to that level.

### Example 1

<p>

**Input:** root = [1, 3, 2, 5, 3, null, 9]</p><p>

**Output:** 4</p><p>

**Explanation:** </p>So if the below tree would be a complete binary tree then there would be total 4 nodes in the last level.

So the maximum width of the binary tree is between the nodes with value 5 and 9 is equal to 4.

### Example 2

<p>

**Input:** root = [1, 3, 2, 5, null, null, 9, 6, null, 7]</p><p>

**Output:** 7</p><p>

**Explanation:** </p>If the below tree would be a complete binary tree then at last levels there would b 7 nodes including the node with value 6 and 7.

So the maximum width of binary tree is 7.

### Example 3

<p>

**Input:** root = [5, 1, 2, 8, null, 4, 5, null, 6]</p>Output:

4

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of Nodes <= 3000
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
